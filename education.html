          <h1>EDUCATION LEVEL</h1>
          <p>I have passed by School Leaving Certificate by coring 86.67% in 2015 A.D. Then, I took science faculty for my higher-level studies. I graduated from grade 12 scoring 79.98 % in 2017 A.D from Bishnu Memorial Higher Secondary School Dharan-13, Sunsari.  In my Bachelor level, I took Bachelor of Design in Animation in University of Technology Sydney with a passion for visual arts, drawing and storytelling the knowledge and hands-on experience required to create animation work that stands out in a global industry. I took this subject as this course aims to create new approaches to 2D and 3D animation and VFX design, enabling graduates to better develop, and adapt and respond to a range of creative partnerships and collaborations. After graduating from there I was able to develop an understanding of their individual design language and theoretical position in relation to historic and contemporary contexts.</p>
