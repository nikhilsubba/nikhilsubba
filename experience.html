          <h1>My Experience in daily life as an animator</h1>
          <p>I get to work at 9 a.m. Animate for 8+ hours, go back home too tired to do anything. Rinse and repeat. Probably the best aspect of working in the animation field is being able to bring things to life. The artists at animation industry take pride in knowing that a little piece of themselves can be found in each project we work on. Animation of course requires you to follow a storyboard/layout, place and draw/pose characters, animate the performance, show to the director and fix and revise according to the feedback. And do that until nobody has any more scenes to give you. It is not unlike any other specialist job really. You do what your work title says, a programmer codes, a designer designs, a politician lies (wow there we are having a good time, I’ll be here all week, try the salad).Btw, any animation gig can have very long workdays, so beware before getting in the ship, because once on the ocean it’ll be only your love of sailing that may keep you there. In any case, you could end up working also as a background or prop designer, storyboard artist or revisionist, character designer (generally it takes a few years to get there) and more. It is a nice job to have, if you really like the job.</p>
