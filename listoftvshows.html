            <h1>Your lie in April </h1>
            <p><img src="img/5.png" alt="Your lie in April "  height="300px" width="340px">Your lie in April is a beautiful romantic story of two musicians who play so that the people around them will never ever forget them. One day Kaori's dies. After Kaori's death, her parents give her letter to Kōsei at her funeral. The letter reveals that she was aware that she was about to die, so she became more free-spirited, both as a person and in her music, in order to not take her regrets to Heaven. She also revealed that she had been in love with Kōsei since she was five, and was inspired to play the violin so that she could one day play with him. Her supposed feelings towards Watari was the lie the series was named after, and they were fabricated in order to get closer to Kōsei without emotionally injuring Tsubaki, who also has limerent feelings towards Kōsei. After finding this out, Tsubaki confronts Kōsei and tells him that she will be by his side for the rest of her life. Kaori also left behind a picture of her as a child coming back from the concert that inspired her, with Kōsei in the background walking back home. Kōsei later frames this picture.
